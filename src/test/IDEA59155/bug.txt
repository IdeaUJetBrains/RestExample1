actually no validation is provided for the parameters annotated with @QueryParam or @PathParam annotations.

@QueryParam and @PathParam can only be used on the following Java types:

      All primitive types except char
      All wrapper classes of primitive types except Character
      Any class with the static method named valueOf(String) that accepts a single String argument
      Any class with a constructor that takes a single String as a parameter
      List<T>, Set<T>, or SortedSet<T>, where T matches the already listed criteria.


The same - for @MatrixParam, @HeaderParam, @CookieParam, and @FormParam annotations.
